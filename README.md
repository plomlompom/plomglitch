# plomglitch
variation on erlehmann's libglitch

plomglitch.py is a glitch code / file consumer, see plomglitch.py --help for
details and https://github.com/erlehmann/libglitch for explanations.

soundpixler.py is a tool to directly draw the soundwaves. Just mouse-click into
the screen to manipulate the wave. Use left button for single pixel editing,
middle button for a little larger brush, and right button for the largest one.
Hit F1 to toggle the view from a short wave to a one-second wave that modulates
the short wave's loudness over one second. See soundpixler.py --help for options
to manipulate the frequency and short wave length.
